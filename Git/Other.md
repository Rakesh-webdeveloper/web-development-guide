git branch -d deletes a local branch. Use -D instead of -d to force delete a local branch without checking its merge status.

Fixing the Commit Message Before git push

I often notice a typo or a mistake in my commit message after I commit. Luckily, Git has a way to fix this problem.

$ git commit --amend -m 'New commit message'
To bring up the message editor, donâ€™t provide the -m parameter:

$ git commit --amend
Keep in mind that it will not just modify the commit message but also commit any new changes that you might have. This will not work if you have pushed the commit to remote repository.

git merge --abort

git stash - To save changes made when they're not in a state to commit  them to  a repository.

git rebase - Takes a set of commits, copies them and store them outside the repository.
