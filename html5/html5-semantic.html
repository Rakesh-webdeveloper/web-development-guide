Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language
Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
```
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
```

HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:  

```
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>

```
